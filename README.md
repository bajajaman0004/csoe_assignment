In this project, we have used basic HTML and CSS to design a static 
webpage. The main file which is index.html has the HTML backbone, which 
contains the head, navbar, body, and every other stuff. This HTML is styled 
using the styles.css, which is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) file having all 
the styling attributes such as colors, font style, font size, and what happens 
when we hover over certain options.


This webpage can be thought of as the home page of an invitation to a 
birthday party where we have contact me, About party & time and 
place and menu options which can be linked to further webpages in the 
future. It also has the option of wish me which can further redirect to the 
page of wishing by social media.
